Finding the js name is not too easy you need to dig deep to the plugin folder and look for somthing like this 

<?php wp_register_script( 'sample', 'http://sample.com/wp-content/plugin/js/sample.js' ); ?>

the sample is js name that we need next to it is the url of the plugin/themes insert the js name in the page speed plugin and copy paste the js code and put it in the js field.

Visit your site, right click and view page source
Find the Id of the Css you want to Optimize, remove the "-css" ex. flexslider-css to flexslider
