Moving the js to footer is not easy.. 

you need to dig deep to the plugin folder to find what is the js name of the script you want to move in the footer.

once you find the js name you want to move copy paste first all the script to the page speed plugin then put te js name to the "js name field".

dont worry i will update this plugin for more easier option as soon as posible..

= Where can i find the Css Name of the plugin i want to remove =

Visit your site, right click and view page source
Find the Id of the Css you want to Optimize, remove the "-css" ex. flexslider-css to flexslider
and put it in the Page Speed Plugin, Css Name


Dont Forget to Copy and Paste The Css that you've been remove in the Css Field inside the plugin
